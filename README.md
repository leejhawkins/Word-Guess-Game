Homework 3  (javascript)- Word Guess Game
Hello and welcome to my Word-Guess-Game.  The theme of the game is countries of the world.  Guess the right country and get words of encouragement, fail to guess the right word and the crowd is less forgiving.  

How to play:

Start by choosing any letter.  The game will record non-letter keys so avoid hitting those.
Continue choosing letters until the country name is revealed.
You have 10 wrong letter guesses before you lose.
The game will alert you if you have won or lost and then a new country is automatically set.
The game keeps track of total wins and losses.
